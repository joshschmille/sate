# Space Aces: Terminal Edition (SATE)
SATE is based on [Space Aces: TNG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/346728/Space-Aces-TNG-The-New-Guidebook).

It allows you to play Space Aces in a terminal window, or on a remote server if desired.

## How to Play
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/joshschmille/sate/releases/tag/latest) for your desired OS.
- Extract the archive using your preferred tool (7zip, WinRAR, etc.).
- Run the executable (SATE.exe / SATE) from within your terminal.

- Use the `help` command in the game for more direction, if needed.
